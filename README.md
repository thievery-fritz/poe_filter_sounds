# ivory_fitz PoE Loot Filter Sounds

This is a hodgepodge collection of TTS, sound bytes/clips, whatever else that I use in my filters/filter modules.

My filters/modules will expect these sounds to be inside the `sounds` folder within the same folder where you'd download the filter files to. (On my machine, that is `C:\Users\my_user_name\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile`)

So these mp3 files should live inside...
`C:\Users\my_user_name\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile\sounds`

If you don't do that, you'll get file load errors.

So if you just download the repo, then copy/paste the sounds folder, you're good to go.
